## Getting started

Welcome to the *Agent Development Track*! The following tutorial video will walk you through the steps to set up agent training environment.

<!-- TODO: need a new tutorial that shows testing in local build-->

**Note**: We are updating the video and will release soon. At the meantime, please refer to the set up instructions in [readme](https://github.com/STRONG-TACT/Dice-Adventure-Agents). Here are a few steps:

1. Clone the [agent template](https://github.com/STRONG-TACT/Dice-Adventure-Agents) and install required packages.
2. Connect to the game. \\
We provided a random agent under "examples" folder that you can use to test agent connection with the game.
    - You can connect to the game in Unity editor, in this way you can edit the game settings and make your own testing levels.
        - Clone the [game repo](https://github.com/STRONG-TACT/HMT-Game-1).
        - Open in Unity editor and hit ‚ñ∂Ô∏è.
    - You can also connect to a local build of the game.
        - [Download the latest build](https://github.com/STRONG-TACT/HMT-Game-1/actions) that is compatible with your system.
        - Double click to run the **.exe** file
3. Run `python play_game.py`.
