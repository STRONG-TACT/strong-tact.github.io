## How to Play
Dice Adventure is now available on [itch.io](https://cmu-tact.itch.io/dice-adventure). We also released multi-platform [local builds](https://github.com/STRONG-TACT/HMT-Game-1/actions) of the game for players to explore and for developers to test their agents.
We are planning for virtual and in-person matchmaking sessions in **July, 2025** and details will be announced in June, 2025.
<!-- You can jump on the game and play at any time from **May 8, 2024** to **July 7, 2024**. The AI agent will be online on **June 15, 2024**. Virtual match making events will be hosted between **July 16, 2024** and **July 27, 2024**.  -->
The game supports two play modes --- the *practice* mode and the *competition* mode. In the *practice* mode (already released), you can switch between the three characters to get familiar with the game. The *competition* mode will only be available at matchmaking events.

**Note**: Please download the latest build as we may push some minor fixes of the game.

## Matchmaking Events

<!-- signup link for competitions -->
We will be organizing a series of in-person and virtual matchmaking events. Please [sign up here](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1IlcmOGhbH43OMm) to get registered.
Players will be randomly assigned to a team consists of other human players and/or AI agents.
<!-- Though players can form any teams when playing the game, only hybrid teams will be considered as competition entries and can compete for the cash prize. -->
There are three allocations for the  teams: 
1. Two human players and one AI agent
2. One human player and two AI agents.
3. Three human players.

- **In-person**: there will be multiple one-day play sesssions throughout July. We are now working finalizing the dates and schedule and will post deatils in June.
- **Online**: we will be organizing a few virtual matchmaking sessions in July as well but outside of the in-person sesssions. Detailed information and schedule will be posted soon.
