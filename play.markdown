## How to Play
Dice Adventure is now available on [itch.io](https://cmu-tact.itch.io/dice-adventure). We will also release a local build of the game for players to explore and for developers to test their agents. You can jump on the game and play at any time from **May 8, 2024** to **July 15, 2024**. The AI agent will be online on **June 15, 2024**. Virtual match making events will be hosted between **June 15, 2024** and **July 15, 2024**. The game supports two play modes --- the *exhibition* mode and the *tournament* mode. In the *exhibition* mode, you can select from a list of currently available agents you want to play with and assign rolse to the agent. The *tournament* mode will only be available at match-making event.
